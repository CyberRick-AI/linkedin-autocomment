"""THROWAWAY SPIKE - can Buffer's API replace the browser-based scheduled poster?

Branch `buffer-spike`. Not production code, not wired into anything, and it
imports nothing from linkedin_automation. If the answer is no, this file is
deleted; if it is yes, the browser post/image/schedule build is dropped and this
gets rewritten properly.

The question is narrow: does ONE Buffer API call schedule a LinkedIn post with

    text (+ a hashtag)   an image   a dueAt   AND a first comment

on the dev channel, and does it actually publish that way? The first comment is
the whole reason the feature exists, so a spike that proves everything except
that has proved nothing.

VERIFY, DO NOT TRUST THE DOCS. Step 2 introspects the live schema and reports
what the API actually accepts - the field names, whether
LinkedInPostMetadataInput really has firstComment, and what shape `assets`
takes - before any post is created. Docs describing a field is not evidence the
field works.

Read-only by default. Nothing is created unless --create is passed, because
createPost against a connected channel schedules a real post on a real account.

    uv run python tools/buffer_spike.py --create --image-url https://...

BUFFER_API_KEY comes from the environment (.env). It is never printed, never
logged, and never committed.
