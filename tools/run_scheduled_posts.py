"""Run the CSV -> scheduled post -> first comment pipeline.

TWO PASSES, because Buffer publishes at dueAt and a content calendar schedules
days apart:

    schedule   validate every row and create every Buffer post. Fast.
    comment    sweep for posts that have since published and comment them.
               Non-blocking, idempotent, safe to run on a timer.

    uv run python tools/run_scheduled_posts.py schedule --csv posts.csv \\
        --channel-id <id> --profile dev
    uv run python tools/run_scheduled_posts.py comment --profile dev \\
        --expect-identity your-profile-slug

`comment` is the one to put on a schedule - every 15 minutes is ample, since it
does nothing for rows whose posts have not published yet.

Nothing here can re-publish a post. A row that already has one is skipped by the
schedule pass, whatever else failed.
