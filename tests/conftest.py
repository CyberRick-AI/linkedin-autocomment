    Two problems this closes, both real in this repo and neither caught by any
    existing test (adopted from the fork's hermeticity guard, see
    .dev/AUDIT_fork_remainder.md §4):

    **A funded key was visible to every test.** ``load_dotenv()`` runs at import
    time in several modules, so merely importing the package loaded the
    developer's real ``.env`` into ``os.environ``. Nothing spent it, because the
    OpenAI client is mocked everywhere — but that is protection by coincidence.
    One missed mock reaches a real vendor and bills a real account.

    **The suite depended on ambient environment.** Code that resolves a key
    raises when none is set, so a result could depend on whether the developer
    happened to have one exported. A suite whose outcome varies with the machine
    is not a suite you can act on.

    Setting rather than deleting: code paths that check for a key's *presence*
    must still take the same branch they take in production.

def _no_live_buffer_calls(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Make an outbound Buffer request impossible for EVERY test — no exceptions.

    Same shape and same reasoning as ``_dummy_api_keys``: the suite claimed to be
    offline and was offline only by coincidence. Eight tests in
    ``test_scheduled_ui.py`` really did reach ``api.buffer.com``, through the
    queue endpoint's poll-on-render reconcile, and nothing failed — the only
    symptom was a line in ``api_usage.jsonl``. A guard that produces no failure
    is not a guard.

    This closes it at the TRANSPORT, which is the one place every Buffer call
    must pass through, so a future caller reaching the network fails loudly
    instead of quietly spending the 3,000-request/30-day budget and making the
    result depend on a real key, a network and a third party's uptime.

    It patches the HTTP transport rather than ``gql``, because ``gql`` itself is
    legitimately exercised: ``test_buffer_client.py`` drives it with a fake
    ``session`` to test status handling, retries and the usage log, and never
    reaches the network. ``gql`` resolves ``(session or requests).post``, so
    replacing the module's ``requests`` blocks exactly the calls that would go
    out and leaves the session-injected ones alone.

    A test that wants Buffer behaviour mocks the boundary it uses —
    ``posts_by_status``, ``get_channel``, ``scheduled_slots``, or an injected
    ``session`` — which is what the rest of the suite already does.
