"""CSV -> scheduled LinkedIn post -> first comment. Phase 5 of the hybrid.

Ties Phases 1-4 together:

    validate -> generate text if blank -> R2 upload -> Buffer createPost
             -> (later) poll to sent -> browser first comment

**TWO PASSES, NOT ONE.** Buffer publishes at ``dueAt``, and a content calendar
schedules days apart. An inline model - create a post, wait for it to publish,
comment, move on - would mean a process sitting for days, where a crash or a
closed laptop loses every row after the current one. So:

    SCHEDULE pass   validates and creates every post now. Minutes, not days.
    COMMENT pass    sweeps for posts that have since published and comments
                    them. Non-blocking: a row not yet due is simply left for
                    the next sweep, so this is safe to run on a timer.

The comment pass is idempotent by construction, which is what makes the whole
thing resumable: run it as often as you like.

**THE POST IS IRREVERSIBLE ONCE PUBLISHED**, and the state machine is built
around that. A row that already has a ``post_id`` is NEVER passed to createPost
again, whatever else failed. Re-running the CSV after a partial failure retries
the comment, never the post.
